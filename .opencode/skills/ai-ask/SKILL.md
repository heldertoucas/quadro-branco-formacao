description: >-
  Recommends which skill, command, or workflow fits your situation. Use when the
  user asks to find a skill, route a task, or when you are unsure which workflow
  to use. Do not use when the workflow is already obvious or explicitly
  requested.

# AI Ask Router

Use this skill when guidance is needed on which specialized skill, command, or workflow fits the current development phase.

## 🎯 Dual-Mode Responses

1. **User-Facing (Human Chat)**: When triggered with /ai-ask <question>, reply in a clean, formatted manner matching the user's language (PT-PT or International English). State the recommended skill(s), how to invoke them, and a brief explanation of why they fit.
2. **Agent-Facing (Internal Navigation)**: When navigating a task, query this mapping to ensure adherence to domain guidelines. Never route to the active router (i-ask) itself.
3. **Validation Loop**: Ensure the recommended skill exists in the Rulesync catalog. Provide numbered options if user decision is needed.
